-- https://sqlzoo.net/wiki/The_JOIN_operation

-- 1. Modify it to show the matchid and player name for all goals scored by Germany. To identify German players, check for: teamid = 'GER'
select a.id, b.player 
from game a 
join 
goal b 
on a.id = b.matchid
where b.teamid = 'GER'

-- 2. Notice in the that the column matchid in the goal table corresponds to the id column in the game table. We can look up information about game 1012 by finding that row in the game table.
Show id, stadium, team1, team2 for just game 1012
select distinct a.id,a.stadium,a.team1,a.team2
from game a 
join 
goal b 
on a.id = b.matchid
where b.matchid= 1012


-- 3. Modify it to show the player, teamid, stadium and mdate for every German goal.
select g.player, g.teamid, ga.stadium, ga.mdate from
goal g 
join game ga
on g.matchid = ga.id
where g.teamid = 'GER'


-- 4. Show the team1, team2 and player for every goal scored by a player called Mario player LIKE 'Mario%'
select g.team1, g.team2, go.player 
from game g
join goal go

where go.player like 'Mario%'


-- 5. Show player, teamid, coach, gtime for all goals scored in the first 10 minutes gtime<=10
select go.player, go.teamid, e.coach, go.gtime 
from goal go
join
eteam e
on go.teamid = e.id
where go.gtime<=10


-- 6. List the the dates of the matches and the name of the team in which 'Fernando Santos' was the team1 coach.
select g.mdate, e.teamname
from game g
join eteam e
on g.team1 = e.id
where
e.coach = 'Fernando Santos'


-- 7. List the player for every goal scored in a game where the stadium was 'National Stadium, Warsaw'
select go.player 
from goal go
join 
game gg
on go.matchid = gg.id
where gg.stadium = 'National Stadium, Warsaw'


-- 8. Instead show the name of all players who scored a goal against Germany
SELECT DISTINCT player 
FROM game 
JOIN goal 
ON matchid = id 
WHERE (teamid!='GER' AND (team1='GER' OR team2='GER'))


--Show teamname and the total number of goals scored.
select e.teamname, count(go.gtime)
from eteam e
join goal go
on e.id = go.teamid
group by(e.teamname)


--	10. Show the stadium and the number of goals scored in each stadium.
select g.stadium, count(go.gtime)
from game g
join goal go
on g.id = go.matchid
group by(g.stadium)


-- 11. For every match involving 'POL', show the matchid, date and the number of goals scored.
select g.id,g.mdate, count(go.gtime)
from game g
join goal go
on g.id = go.matchid
where (g.team1='POL' or g.team2='POL')
group by g.mdate,g.id


-- 12. For every match where 'GER' scored, show matchid, match date and the number of goals scored by 'GER'
select g.id, g.mdate, count(go.gtime)
from game g
join goal go
on g.id = go.matchid
where go.teamid = 'GER'
group by g.id, g.mdate

-- 13. 	List every match with the goals scored by each team as shown. This will use "CASE WHEN" which has not been explained in any previous exercises.
SELECT mdate,
  team1,
  SUM(CASE WHEN teamid=team1 THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) score1,
  team2,
  SUM(CASE WHEN teamid=team2 THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) score2
